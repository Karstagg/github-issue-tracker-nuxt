# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
-I don't know nuxt and I haven't used vue in years, probably since v1

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?
- searching again from the results page

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
- a more complicated search that allows you to enter more than just a URL to get relevant data, different view options (list, table, etc)

---

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
- I chose to give nuxt a shot because it was the most desirably framework for the assigner of the project. 

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
-learning framework: ~2 hours (had to learn as I went)
-coding: 7 (lack of experience with nuxt/vue)
-debugging: 1.5 hours (some things are still not working but overall much easier to debug than react

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
-Have a much less busy week so that completing a project in an unfamiliar framework is more feasible
-Nuxt does so much for you, don't over think things and just google 

> Did you learn anything new?
- I learned a huge amount from this. Nuxt is amazing (as is vue) and I wish I got to work with them on a more regular basis. Even with minimal knowledge of vue and no knowledge of nuxt the project
was both fun and not so challenging as to make me give up. 

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
- It's difficult to say. If you mean ability to create a reliable product with perfect functionality and styling? No. If you mean ability to learn a framework that is completely different
from what I use on a day to day basis and create an (almost) MVP with it. Sure. 

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
-I am a reasonably competent backend developer, especially with frameworks.
-I'm able to work with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
-I can do devops tasks and server config
